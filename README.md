> Collect dissolved oxygen depth profiles

This project uses a winch and dissolved oxygen probe to automatically measure DO at various depths in Barton Pond, Ann Arbor's drinking water source. This firmware controls the winch and sensor and sends measurement data to an InfluxDB server for visualization and analysis. We hope the data gathered will allow for better prediction of algal blooms and lake overturning.
